        <div id="top1"><a name="top1"></a>"Carnival" is a word often associated with amusement parks and merriment in the US.  In this case, there are no amusement parks, instead, Caribbean Carnival is a time of revelry and debauchery. Over the past few years, I've had the pleasure of travelling the world to different Caribbean Carnivals.  Here is some basic information on Caribbean Carnivals. <br>While Carnival takes different forms in different locations,I will refernce Trinidad & Tobago's Carnival as the reference point.</br> <br>In Trinidad & Tobago, Carnival lasts months and culminates in large celebrations in Port of Spain on the three days before Ash Wednesday with Dimanche Gras, J'ouvert, and Mas (masquerade). Carnival combines costumes, dance, music, competitions, rum, and partying (fete-ing). Music styles include soca, calypso, rapso, and more recently Chutney soca.</br></div>
        
        <div id="Gen"><section id ="General"><a name="General"></a><h2>General</h2> <img id="cost" src="img/costume.jpg"><p class="textleft"><p>Caribbean carnivals have several common themes, many originating from Trinidad and Tobago Carnival.  These themes are based on folklore, culture, religion, and tradition - relating to the European use of the word (carne val- farewell to meat - thought to be linked to the Lenten holy period), not amusement rides, as the word "carnival" is often used in American English.
            
            Carnival tradition is based on a number of disciplines including: <a href="#Carnival">"Playing Mas"/masquerade</a>; <a href="#Other">calypso music and crowning a Calypso King or Monarch; Panorama (steel band competition)</a>; <a href="#J'ouvert">J'ouvert morning</a>; and a number of other traditions.</p><img class="picright"> <img id="genpic"> <a href="#top1">Back to Top</a></section></div>
        
        
        <div id="Loc"><section><a name="Locations"></a><h2>Locations</h2> <img class="picleft">  <img id="locpic"> <p>Carnival is held many places around the world. In 2017 alone, across North America, five (5) Canadian provinces and 27 US cities are scheduled to host a Caribbean Carnival. Twenty-seven (27) cities in the United Kingdom, a few cities in Europe as well as Tokyo,Japan also host Caribbean Carnivals. This goes well beyond the Central and South American locales and the thirty-two (32) Caribbean islands that some would automatically assume  host as well.</p> <a href="#top1">Back to Top</a></section></div>
        
        <div id="jouv"><section><a name="J'ouvert"></a><h2>J'ouvert</h2> <p class="textleft"><p>J'ouvert is a large street party held during Caribbean Carnivals. In some of the French-based creole languages of the Caribbean, j'ouvert means "dawn" or "daybreak". It is a contraction of the French words jour ("day") and ouvert ("open"), and also offers the possible "double entendre" of "I opened." Traditionally, the celebration involves calypso/soca bands and their followers dancing through the streets. The festival starts well before dawn and peaks a few hours after sunrise.
        
        J'ouvert, or "Dirty Mas", takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. Revelers dress in costumes embodying puns on current affairs, especially political and social events. "Clean Mud" (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J'ouvert. A common character is "Jab-jabs" (devils, blue, black, or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J'ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.

The origins of street parties associated with J'ouvert coincide with the emancipation from slavery in 1838. Emancipation provided Africans with the opportunity, to not only participate in Carnival, but to embrace it as an expression of their newfound freedom. Some theorize that some J'ouvert traditions are carried forward in remembrance of civil disturbances in Port of Spain, Trinidad, when the people smeared themselves with oil or paint to avoid being recognized.

In some countries, J'ouvert is celebrated on the first day of August (Emanicipation Day), and yet for other Caribbean countries, J'ouvert is observed the night before the daytime "Pretty Mas" parade.

The traditions of J'ouvert vary widely throughout the Caribbean. In Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, a part of the tradition involves smearing paint, mud or oil on the bodies of participants known as "Jab Jabs".

J'ouvert values the transgressive dirt while Pretty Mas celebrates the transcendent glitter. J'ouvert can further be contrasted with Pretty Mas such that J'ouvert is said to be for "the people" while Pretty Mas is intended for the establishment.

Barbados does not celebrate J'ouvert, but instead celebrates Foreday Morning, which is often likened to J'ouvert.</p><img class="picright"> <img id="jouvertpic"><a href="#top1">Back to Top</a></section></div>
        
        <div id="carn"><section><a name="Carnival"><h2>Mas</h2> <img class="picleft"><img id="maspic"> <img src="img/prettymas.jpg"> <img src="img/masq.jpg"><img src="img/costume.jpg"><img src="img/red-cost.jpg"></img>
        <p class="textright"> <p> "Pretty Mas," a bright and festive version of the celebration, features colorful feathers and beaded costumes and is more popular and commercially publicized. Carnival was introduced to Trinidad by French settlers in 1783, a time of slavery. Banned from the masquerade balls of the French, the slaves would stage their own mini-carnivals in their backyards — using their own rituals and folklore, but also imitating and sometimes mocking their masters’ behavior at the masquerade balls. Carnival Monday involves the parade of the mas bands. Revelers wear only parts of their costumes, more for fun than display or competition. Monday Night Mas is popular in most towns and especially the capital, where smaller bands compete. There is also the "Bomb Competition", a smaller-scaled judging of steel bands.

Carnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually "Mas Boots" that complement the costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers) that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen's Park Savannah to pass on "The Stage" for judging. The singer of the most played song is crowned Road March King or Queen, earning prize money and usually a vehicle.[citation needed]

This parading and revelry goes on until Tuesday midnight. Ash Wednesday itself, while not an official holiday, sends flocks to local beaches. The most popular are Maracas Beach and Manzanilla Beach, where huge beach parties take place on Ash Wednesday.</p><a href="#top1">Back to Top</a></section></div>
        
        <div id="Oth"><section><a name="Other"></a><h2>Other</h2> <p>The annual Carnival steel pan competition known as the National Panorama competition holds the finals on the Saturday before the main event. Pan players compete in categories such as "Conventional Steel Band" or "Single Pan Band" by performing renditions of the year's calypsos.

"Dimanche Gras" takes place on the Sunday night before Ash Wednesday. Here the Calypso Monarch is chosen (after competition) and prize money and a vehicle awarded. The King and Queen of the bands are crowned, where each band parades costumes for two days and submits a king and queen, from which an overall winner is chosen. These usually involve huge, complex, beautiful well-crafted costumes, that includes 'wire-bending'.</div>
