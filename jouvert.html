<h2>J'ouvert</h2> <p> J'ouvert (pronounced ju-vay) is a large street party held during Caribbean Carnivals. J'ouvert means "dawn" or "daybreak". It is a contraction of the French words jour ("day") and ouvert ("open"). Traditionally, the celebration involves calypso/soca bands and their followers dancing through the streets. The festival starts well before dawn and peaks a few hours after sunrise.</p>
<p>J'ouvert, or "Dirty Mas", takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. It means "opening of the day". Revellers dress in costumes reflecting satirical commentary on current affairs, especially political and social events. "Clean Mud" (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J'ouvert. A common character is "Jab-jabs" (devils, blue, black, or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J'ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.</p>
<p>The origins of street parties associated with J'ouvert coincide with the emancipation from slavery in 1838. Emancipation provided Africans with the opportunity to not only participate in Carnival, but to embrace it as an expression of their newfound freedom. Some theorize that some J'ouvert traditions are carried forward in remembrance of civil disturbances in Port of Spain, Trinidad, when the people smeared themselves with oil or paint to avoid being recognized.</p>
<p>
The traditions of J'ouvert vary widely throughout the Caribbean. In some countries, J'ouvert is celebrated on the first day of August (Emanicipation Day), and yet for other Caribbean countries, J'ouvert is observed the night before the daytime "Pretty Mas" parade. In Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, a part of the tradition involves smearing paint, mud or oil on the bodies of participants known as "Jab Jabs". The word jab has its roots in the French word “Diable,” meaning “devil.” Thus, in the Grenadian context, Jab Jab, as it is used, means “devil, devil” or “double-devil.” Barbados does not celebrate J'ouvert, but instead celebrates Foreday Morning, which is often likened to J'ouvert.</p>
 <p>
J'ouvert values the transgressive dirt while "Pretty Mas" celebrates the transcendent glitter. J'ouvert can further be contrasted with Pretty Mas such that J'ouvert is said to be for "the people" while Pretty Mas is intended for the establishment.</p>
